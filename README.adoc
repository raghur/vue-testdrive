# VueJS starter

## Base

so the base for this project is the ASP.NET Core vue SPA template that ships
with 2.0 of ASP.NET core.

## Why

Basically digging around and tweaking things, found a bunch of things that
could be improved in general. Should help future me when I want to build an
actual web UI. A few of the things 

. Upgraded to latest Vue(2.3.2 -> 2.4.2) and Typescript (2.3 -> 2.4)
. Got rid of `awesome-typescript-loader` and got back `ts-loader` which *lets
you import .vue components* easily.
. Added examples of simple components,
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Named-Slots[slots] and
https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/intro.html[vuex].
. Added example of *unit testing components* with `avoriaz` and plain vue with 
karma, mocha, chai & sinon. 
. Unit test runs report *code coverage* tracked back to original Typescript source.
. Updated webpack config to handle debugging tests with source map support - meaning
you can *place breakpoints directly in Typescript code when debugging in Chrome*.
. Added examples of *bundling components into chunks* -
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Async-Components[Vue Async
Component] + https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/[webpack's code
splitting] feature.
. Hooked in babel-loader in webpack - so ts transpilation path is 
`TS ---ts-loader---> ES2015 ----babel-loader--> ES5`. This lets us use the *dynamic 
import statement* in TS 2.4 for defining async components.
. Removed .vue.html extension and named back to .vue - works better with the
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur[vetur] plugin
under VS Code.


## Getting started

. Clone this repo
. Run `yarn install`. # Read <<Why Yarn (aka Why not NPM),Why Yarn>> below
. `set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`
. Run it with `dotnet run`
. Visit `localhost:5000/`

### To run client side tests

After you have done `yarn install` run `yarn run test`

## Notes - Unit testing and code coverage.

Getting Karma, webpack and code coverage to play nice with each other took some doing.
As of this writing (Sep 2017), karma coverage was broken when used with ts transpilation and html report
generation fails with error. 

. For getting code coverage across all your code, you need to create an index.js which pulls in
all your tests and all your sources.
. In karma.conf.js, we set `env={test:1}` and then require our webpack conf. Within webpack config,
we instrument sources with `istanbul-instrumenter-loader` based on test being true.
. In a test build, we also add a rule for building ts files under `test` without the instrumenter.
. In karma config, we replace `karma-coverage` with

## Notes - Debugging unit tests with Karma & sourcemaps

A good dev experience is critical - so being able to debug unit tests in browser is important. Since
the source gets transpiled before it reaches the browser, having source map support is super critical.
Getting this to work again was jumping through hoops - karma and webpack handovers aren't exactly well
documented. In the end, I could get it to work only with the following:

. Don't include code coverage instrumentation while debugging - pretty self evident.
. Include inline source maps in test/dev builds
+
[source, javascript]
-------------
        .concat(isDevBuild || isTestBuild ? [
            // this is required for source map debugging 
            new webpack.SourceMapDevToolPlugin({
                filename: null, // only inline source maps seem to work when debugging with chrome
                moduleFilenameTemplate: path.relative(bundleOutputDir, '[resourcePath]'), // Point sourcemap entries to the original file locations on disk
                test: /\.(ts|js|vue)$/
            }),
        ] : [
        // prod config
        ]
-------------
. Use `karma-sourcemap-loader` in karma conf

## Why Yarn (aka Why not NPM)

So when I started this repo, I did not know any better and used npm. And then there were problems!

### Background
`Package.json` only specifies a semver range and w ith packages being updated
all the time and front end projects seemingly depending on 10s of packages and
then those depending on further packages, it's a miracle that anything actually
works. To get around this and have reproducible builds, NPM generates
`npm-shrinkwrap.json` which you're supposed to commit into version control.
Good - that's what I did but it turns out that it didn't do what it said on the tin.

After a few months when I cloned this repo, I started getting weird errors that
I did not remember seeing earlier. Ditto for the folks who cloned this repo. 

Bottomline - `npm-shrinkwrap.json` is supposed to give you reproducible set of
packages in `node_modules` only that it doesn't. Apparently, this is in part
due to NPM's use of non-deterministic resolution algorithm. Should you want to
